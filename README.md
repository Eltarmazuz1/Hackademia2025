This is an educational web application built with React, aimed at helping students and teachers manage tasks by subject and difficulty — and intelligently pair students for learning based on their performance.

✨ Features
🔐 Authentication: Users register as either students or teachers, entering their full name, email, username, school, and password.

📂 Task Categorization: Tasks are organized by topics like Algebra, Geometry, and Calculus. Students can browse and solve tasks per category.

✅ Progress Tracking: Each task is labeled with a status: pending, in-progress, or completed.

🤝 Smart Study Partner Matching:

Matches students based on performance data.

Example: A student who excels in Algebra but struggles with Geometry can be paired with someone who shows the opposite pattern.

Supports matching strong students with weaker ones to promote peer learning.

🧑‍🏫 Teacher Dashboard (coming soon): Allows teachers to monitor student progress and suggest optimal learning pairs.

🔔 Real-time UI Feedback: Clean design with toast notifications for login, errors, and task updates.

📱 Responsive UI: Built with TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui for modern, mobile-friendly layout.
